# mazu_talk
Here is a collection of notebooks used for development and training of AIs for project "Mazu: Water Legends."

Currently, there are two notebooks:
* `mazu_talk.ipynb`: a transformer based, GPT style decoder that generates text.
* `ddm_mazu_sea.ipynb`: a diffusion based AI that generates images.

A third notebook is under development, but not yet included in the repository. That AI is using transformers to generate music scores, and is intended as an assistant for music composition.
